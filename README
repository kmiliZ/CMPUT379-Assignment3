    client.cpp
    commands.cpp

Assumptions:
    1. port number should be in the range 5000 to 64000
    2. input files used are in the correct format. input file only contains two type of commands:
        T<n> Transaction. The parameter is an integer > 0. This command will be sent to the server
            for processing. The client sits idle waiting for the server to complete the transaction.
        S<n> Sleep. This command simulates having the client wait between receiving new
            transactions to process. The client waits for a time determined by integer parameter
        n, with n between 0 and 100. 
    3. Maximum number of clients is 30.
    4. Server will automatically time out and exit afte 30 secs of no incoming transcations from client.

Instruction:
    1. run make to produce the executables for server and client, and the pdf for manual pages.
    2. Always run server first. In order to do that, run ./server port, where port is the port number that the server listens to for communications from clients.
    3. for client, run ./client port ip-address, where ip-address is the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the machine that is hosting the
    server, and port is the port number that the server will read from. Port should be the same that the server uses. 
    4. Then you can either direct a input file : ./client port ip-address <Input_File_Name, or give commands by entering in the command line.
